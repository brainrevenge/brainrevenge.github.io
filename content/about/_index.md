Brain(RevEng)e is a collection of projects that aim to reverse engineer workings of the human brain. The approach we take for this is to optimize desired properties based on multi-modal neuroimaging data.

We are researchers located in the Forschungszentrum Jülich and are part of the INM-7 Brain and Behaviour institute and the Institute of Systems Neuroscience at the University of Düsseldorf in Germany.
